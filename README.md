# Verilog Practice Projects

## 1. UART_tx_rx
Asynchronous data transmission between a transmitter and a receiver module.<br>
Bits are sent and received using a Baud Rate Generator.<br>
What i learned:
-> UART protocol basics: data framing, start/stop bits, asynchronous data transfer.<br>
-> Transmit/Receive data pipelines(tdr/tsr and rsr/rdr).<br>
-> Unit testing is very important, testing after all code is written is a bad idea.<br>
-> Modular design is useful for easier an easier testing phase.<br>
